# TURTLE_SIM_LAWNMOVER
## A basic ROS Project to perform a Lawnmover pattern in Turtlesim Environment


It consists of 3 files : 

1.[ses1.py](https://github.com/Aravind-Adhith/Turtle_Sim_Lawnmover/blob/main/ses/src/ses_1.py) - Simulates the S-Pattern from a entered coordinates

2.[teleport.py](https://github.com/Aravind-Adhith/Turtle_Sim_Lawnmover/blob/main/ses/src/teleport.py) - Code to use Teleport Services to move the turtle to specific position

3.[test.py](https://github.com/Aravind-Adhith/Turtle_Sim_Lawnmover/blob/main/ses/src/test.py) - File that was used to test specific blocks of code


Below are the simulation pictures :
